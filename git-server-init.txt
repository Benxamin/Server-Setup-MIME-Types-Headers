Documenting setting up a "git server repo" from the cmd line:

1) Navigate to the directory where the repo will live.  Create a directory with the name of the repo and ".git" at the end.  (This is convention only, to let a person looking at the directory name know it is a git repo.)

2) Navigate (cd) into the new directory

3) Type "git init --bare" 

4) Navigate to your project directory (this will assume you have already initialized your git repo locally and have made previous commits).

5) Type "git remote add [REMOTE NAME] [PATH TO REMOTE SERVER DIRECTORY]".  
-Remote Name is often "origin" or "central" in this case, but can be anything
-Path to the remote server is the path to the directory you executed the "git inti --bare"

6) Type "git push --all [REMOTE NAME] -u"
-this will push all local branches and setup tracking by default
-to only push a single brach, use "git push --set-upstream [REMOTE NAME] [BRANCH NAME]" (use 'master' for the branch name if you only have the one branch)

7) All done!
